    <title>The Seven Stages of Expertise in Software Engineering</title>

    <summary>This article is still **relevant for any startup or company involved in software development**. It contains useful informations - just like &quot;Clean Code&quot; by Robert C Martin - **details within this article are timeless**.

I first came across this article around 2016, when I noticed a large **disparity between the usual junior-mid-senior scaling** of developers. This scaling system, unlike others, is **universal**, easy to understand, and **the bear hunting analogy** used in the original article by Meilir Page-Jones makes it a **humorous and enjoyable read**.

Since then, the original page has been taken down (an archive can be found here). With the permission of the author, I am allowed to distribute the original article.

I made some slight changes by adding additional titles and styling. **Since there is more behind the seven stages, it is likely to be referenced frequently.**

**We hope you enjoy reading this article and that it helps your next projects be successful.**</summary>
