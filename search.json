Missing software related processes made it hard to track progress or to track deployed changes also lead to faulty deployments too (both on .NET and Angular side).\n\nNon-ideal tool selection for synchronization logic - showed as a problem just later on, the functions in Azure Logic App were repetitive, hard to adjust, ignored some architectural characteristics of the platform (rate limiting), and the ineffective (non-batched) coding approach resulted in long synchronization times and sometimes even failing without a trace.\n\nFirst steps we took\n\nStabilized deployment and traceability of work by introducing git-flow, creating CI/CD pipeline in Azure DevOps.\n\nWe fixed architecture, and introduced environment settings in the applications, and defined some routing rules for UI.\n\nStarted to replace the UI screens step-by step. This included changes inside the API (back-end) code.\n\nAt the end of the 2nd month: the entire application was replaced with a new one (redesigned screens, stable functions)\nFrom this moment on we could focus on new enhancements and continuous improvements.\nNew possibilities\nHaving less support tickets (bugs) enabled us to focus on getting the sync process right - we moved from Azure App Logic to a custom but generic .NET function, which we executed periodically via integrating Hangfire.IO to the back-end.\nWe were able to react to new business requirements instantly as time spent on upkeep was reduced considerably. This enabled us new projects and further possibilities.\nFinal state\nThe project is still in use. It requires minimal technical attention and has worked without intervention for over months in a strike."
