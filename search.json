        "text": "This is a summary on how to write new posts!\nNaming and Path\nCreate a new file named YYYY-MM-DD-TITLE.EXTENSION and put it in the _posts/ of the root directory. Please note that the EXTENSION must be one of md and markdown.\nFront Matter\nBasically, you need to fill the Front Matter as below at the top of the post:\n---title: TITLEdate: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +/-TTTTcategories: [TOP_CATEGORIE, SUB_CATEGORIE]tags: [TAG] # TAG names should always be lowercase---\n\nNote: The posts’ layout has been set to post by default, so there is no need to add the variable layout in Front Matter block.\n\nTimezone of date\nIn order to accurately record the release date of a post, you should not only setup the timezone of _config.yml but also provide the the post’s timezone in field date of its Front Matter block. Format: +/-TTTT, e.g. +0800.\nCategories and Tags\nThe categories of each post is designed to contain up to two elements, and the number of elements in tags can be zero to infinity. For instance:\ncategories: [Animal, Insect]tags: [bee]\nTable of Contents\nBy default, the Table of Contents (TOC) is displayed on the right panel of the post. If you want to turn it off globally, go to _config.yml and set the value of variable toc to false. If you want to turn off TOC for specific post, add the following to post’s Front Matter:\n---toc: false---\nComments\nSimilar to TOC, the Disqus comments is loaded by default in each post, and the global switch is defined by variable comments in file _config.yml . If you want to close the comment for specific post, add the following to the Front Matter of the post:\n---comments: false---\nMathematics\nFor website performance reasons, the mathematical feature won’t be loaded by default. But it can be enabled by:\n---math: true---\nMermaid\nMermaid is a great diagrams generation tool. To enable it on your post, add the following to the YAML block:\n---mermaid: true---\nThen you can use it like other markdown language: surround the graph code with ```mermaid and ```.\nImages\nPreview image\nIf you want to add an image to the top of the post contents, specify the url and alt attribute for the image:\n---image: src: /path/to/image/file alt: image alternative text---\nImage caption\nAdd italics to the next line of an image，then it will become the caption and appear at the bottom of the image:\n![img-description](/path/to/image)_Image Caption_\nImage size\nYou can specify the width (and height) of a image with width:\n![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: width=\"400\"}\nImage position\nBy default, the image is centered, but you can specify the position by using one of class normal , left and right. For example:\n\nNormal position\nImage will be left aligned in below sample:\n![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .normal}\n\nFloat to the left\n![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .left}\n\nFloat to the right\n![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .right}\n\nLimitation: Once you specify the position of an image, it is forbidden to add the image caption.\nCDN URL\nIf you host the images on the CDN, you can save the time of repeatedly writing the CDN url by assigning the variable img_cdn of _config.yml file:\nimg_cdn: https://cdn.com\nOnce img_cdn is assigned, the CDN url will be added to the path of all images (images of site avatar and posts) starting with /.\nFor instance, when using images:\n![The flower](/path/to/flower.png)\nThe parsing result will automatically add the CDN prefix https://cdn.com before the image path:\n&lt;img src=\"https://cdn.com/path/to/flower.png\" alt=\"The flower\">\nPinned Posts\nYou can pin one or more posts to the top of the home page, and the fixed posts are sorted in reverse order according to their release date. Enable by:\n---pin: true---\nCode Block\nMarkdown symbols ``` can easily create a code block as following examples.\nThis is a common code snippet, without syntax highlight and line number.\n\nSpecific Language\nUsing ```language you will get code snippets with line numbers and syntax highlight.\n\nNote: The Jekyll style {% highlight LANGUAGE %} or {% highlight LANGUAGE linenos %} are not allowed to be used in this theme !\n\n# Yaml code snippetitems: - part_no: A4786 descrip: Water Bucket (Filled) price: 1.47 quantity: 4\nLiquid Codes\nIf you want to display the Liquid snippet, surround the liquid code with {% raw %} and {% endraw %} .\n{% if product.title contains 'Pack' %} This product's title contains the word Pack.{% endif %}\nLearn More\nFor more knowledge about Jekyll posts, visit the Jekyll Docs: Posts."

We have prepared everything for you there!\nFork on GitHub\nFork Chirpy on GitHub and then clone your fork to local.\nInstall gem dependencies by:\n$ bundle\n\nAnd then execute:\n$ bash tools/init.sh\n\nNote: If you don’t plan to deploy your site on GitHub Pages, append parameter option --no-gh at the end of the above command.\n\nWhat it does is:\n\nRemove some files or directories from your repository:\n\n.travis.yml\nfiles under _posts\nfolder docs\n\nIf you use the --no-gh option, the directory .github will be deleted. Otherwise, setup the GitHub Action workflow by removing extension .hook of .github/workflows/pages-deploy.yml.hook, and then remove the other files and directories in folder .github.\n\nAutomatically create a commit to save the changes.\n\nUsage\nConfiguration\nUpdate the variables of _config.yml as needed. Some of them are typical options:\n\nurl\navatar\ntimezone\nlang\n\nRunning Local Server\nYou may want to preview the site contents before publishing, so just run it by:\n$ bundle exec jekyll s\n\nOr run the site on Docker with the following command:\n$ docker run -it --rm \\\n--volume=&quot;$PWD:/srv/jekyll&quot; \\\n-p 4000:4000 jekyll/jekyll \\\njekyll serve\n\nOpen a browser and visit to http://localhost:4000.\nDeployment\nBefore the deployment begins, checkout the file _config.yml and make sure the url is configured correctly. Furthermore, if you prefer the project site and don’t use a custom domain, or you want to visit your website with a base url on a web server other than GitHub Pages, remember to change the baseurl to your project name that starting with a slash, e.g, /project-name.\nNow you can choose ONE of the following methods to deploy your Jekyll site.\nDeploy on GitHub Pages\nFor security reasons, GitHub Pages build runs on safe mode, which restricts us from using plugins to generate additional page files. Therefore, we can use GitHub Actions to build the site, store the built site files on a new branch, and use that branch as the source of the GH Pages service.\nQuickly check the files needed for GitHub Actions build:\n\nEnsure your Jekyll site has the file .github/workflows/pages-deploy.yml. Otherwise, create a new one and fill in the contents of the workflow file, and the value of the on.push.branches should be the same as your repo’s default branch name.\nEnsuer your Jekyll site has file tools/test.sh and tools/deploy.sh. Otherwise, copy them from this repo to your Jekyll site.\n\nAnd then rename your repoistory to &lt;GH-USERNAME&gt;.github.io on GitHub.\nNow publish your Jekyll site by:\n\nPush any commit to remote to trigger the GitHub Actions workflow. Once the build is complete and successful, a new remote branch named gh-pages will appear to store the built site files.\n\nBrowse to your repo’s landing page on GitHub and select the branch gh-pages as the publishing source throught Settings → Options → GitHub Pages:\n\nVisit your website at the address indicated by GitHub.\n\nDeploy on Other Platforms\nOn platforms other than GitHub, we cannot enjoy the convenience of GitHub Actions. Therefore, we should build the site locally (or on some other 3rd-party CI platform) and then put the site files on the server.\nGo to the root of the source project, build your site by:\n$ JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll b\n\nOr build the site with Docker by:\n$ docker run -it --rm \\\n--env JEKYLL_ENV=production \\\n--volume=&quot;$PWD:/srv/jekyll&quot; \\\njekyll/jekyll \\\njekyll build\n\nUnless you specified the output path, the generated site files will be placed in folder _site of the project’s root directory. Now you should upload those files to your web server."

This requires technical knowledge and it’s recommended to keep the google_analytics.pv disabled unless you have a good reason. If your website has low traffic, the page views count would discourage you to write more blogs. With that said, let’s start with the setup.\nSet up Google Analytics\nCreate GA account and property\nFirst, you need to setup your account on Google analytics. While your create your account, you must create your first Property as well.\n\nHead to https://analytics.google.com/ and click on Start Measuring\nEnter your desired Account Name and choose the desired checkboxes\nEnter your desired Property Name. This is the name of the tracker project that appears on your Google Analytics dashboard\nEnter the required information About your business\nHit Create and accept any license popup to setup your Google Analytics account and create your property\n\nCreate Data Stream\nWith your property created, you now need to set up Data Stream to track your blog traffic. After you signup, the prompt should automatically take you to creating your first Data Stream. If not, follow these steps:\n\nGo to Admin on the left column\nSelect the desired property from the drop down on the second column\nClick on Data Streams\nAdd a stream and click on Web\nEnter your blog’s URL\n\nIt should look like this:\n\nNow, click on the new data stream and grab the Measurement ID. It should look something like G-V6XXXXXXXX. Copy this to your _config.yml file\ngoogle_analytics: id: 'G-V6XXXXXXX' # Fill with your Google Analytics ID pv: # The Google Analytics pageviews switch. enabled: false # the next options only valid when `google_analytics.pv` is enabled. proxy_url: '' proxy_endpoint: '' cache: false # pv data local cache, good for the users from GFW area.\nWhen you push these changes to your blog, you should start seeing the traffic on your Google Analytics. Play around with Google Analytics dashboard to get familiar with the options available as it takes like 5 mins to pickup your changes. You should now be able to monitor your traffic in realtime.\n\nSetup Page Views\nThere is a detailed tutorial available to set up Google Analytics superProxy. But, if you are interested to just quickly get your Chirpy-based blog display page views, follow along. These steps were tested on a Linux machine. If you are running Windows, you can use Git bash terminal to run Unix-like commands.\nSetup Google App Engine\n\nVisit https://console.cloud.google.com/appengine\n\nClick on Create Application\n\nClick on Create Project\n\nEnter the name and choose the data center close to you\n\nSelect Python language and Standard environment\n\nEnable billing account. Yeah, you have to link your credit card. But, you won’t be billed unless you exceed your free quota. For a simple blog, free quota is more than sufficient.\n\nGo to your App Engine dashboard on your browser and select API &amp; Services from the left navigation menu\n\nClick on Enable APIs and Services button on the top\n\nEnable the following APIs: Google Analytics API\n\nOn the left, Click on OAuth Consent Screen and accept Configure Consent Screen. Select External since your blog is probably hosted for the public. Click on Publish under Publishing Status\n\nClick on Credentials on the left and create a new OAuth Client IDs credential. Make sure to add a entry under Authorized redirect URIs that matches: https://&lt;project-id&gt;.&lt;region&gt;.r.appspot.com/admin/auth\n\nNote down the Your Client ID and Your Client Secret. You’ll need this in the next section.\n\nDownload and install the cloud SDK for your platform: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstart\n\nRun the following commands:\n[root@bc96abf71ef8 /]# gcloud init\n\n~snip~\n\nGo to the following link in your browser:\n\nhttps://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?response_type=code&amp;client_id=XYZ.apps.googleusercontent.com&amp;redirect_uri=ABCDEFG\n\nEnter verification code: &lt;VERIFICATION CODE THAT YOU GET AFTER YOU VISIT AND AUTHENTICATE FROM THE ABOVE LINK&gt;\n\nYou are logged in as: [blah_blah@gmail.com].\n\nPick cloud project to use:\n[1] chirpy-test-300716\n[2] Create a new project\nPlease enter numeric choice or text value (must exactly match list\nitem): 1\n\n[root@bc96abf71ef8 /]# gcloud info\n# Your selected project info should be displayed here\n\nSetup Google Analytics superProxy\n\nClone the Google Analytics superProxy project on Github: https://github.com/googleanalytics/google-analytics-super-proxy to your local.\n\nRemove the first 2 lines in the src/app.yaml file:\n-application: your-project-id-version: 1\n\nIn src/config.py, add the OAUTH_CLIENT_ID and OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET that you gathered from you App Engine Dashboard.\n\nEnter any random key for XSRF_KEY, your config.py should look similar to this\n#!/usr/bin/python2.7__author__ = 'pete.frisella@gmail.com (Pete Frisella)'# OAuth 2.0 Client SettingsAUTH_CONFIG = { 'OAUTH_CLIENT_ID': 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID', 'OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET': 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET', 'OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI': '%s%s' % ( 'https://chirpy-test-XXXXXX.ue.r.appspot.com', '/admin/auth' )}# XSRF SettingsXSRF_KEY = 'OnceUponATimeThereLivedALegend'\nTip: You can configure a custom domain instead of https://PROJECT_ID.REGION_ID.r.appspot.com. But, for the sake of keeping it simple, we will be using the Google provided default URL.\n\nFrom inside the src/ directory, deploy the app\n[root@bc96abf71ef8 src]# gcloud app deploy\nServices to deploy:\n\ndescriptor: [/tmp/google-analytics-super-proxy/src/app.yaml]\nsource: [/tmp/google-analytics-super-proxy/src]\ntarget project: [chirpy-test-XXXX]\ntarget service: [default]\ntarget version: [VESRION_NUM]\ntarget url: [https://chirpy-test-XXXX.ue.r.appspot.com]\n\nDo you want to continue (Y/n)?

Add a /admin to the end of the URL.\n\nClick on Authorize Users and make sure to add yourself as a managed user.\n\nIf you get any errors, please Google it. The errors are self-explanatory and should be easy to fix.\n\nIf everything went good, you’ll get this screen:\n\nCreate Google Analytics Query\nHead to https://PROJECT_ID.REGION_ID.r.appspot.com/admin and create a query after verifying the account. GA Core Reporting API query request can be created in Query Explorer.\nThe query parameters are as follows:\n\nstart-date: fill in the first day of blog posting\nend-date: fill in today (this is a parameter supported by GA Report, which means that it will always end according to the current query date)\nmetrics: select ga:pageviews\ndimensions: select ga:pagePath\n\nIn order to reduce the returned results and reduce the network bandwidth, we add custom filtering rules [^ga-filters]:\n\nfilters: fill in ga:pagePath=~^/posts/.*/$;ga:pagePath!@=.\nAmong them, ; means using logical AND to concatenate two rules.\nIf the site.baseurl is specified, change the first filtering rule to ga:pagePath=~^/BASE_URL/posts/.*/$, where BASE_URL is the value of site.baseurl.\n\nAfter Run Query, copy the generated contents of API Query URI at the bottom of the page, and fill in the Encoded URI for the query of SuperProxy on GAE.\nAfter the query is saved on GAE, a Public Endpoint (public access address) will be generated, and we will get the query result in JSON format when accessing it. Finally, click Enable Endpoint in Public Request Endpoint to make the query effective, and click Start Scheduling in Scheduling to start the scheduled task.\n\nConfigure Chirpy to Display Page View\nOnce all the hard part is done, it is very easy to enable the Page View on Chirpy theme. Your superProxy dashboard should look something like below and you can grab the required values.\n\nUpdate the _config.yml file of Chirpy project with the values from your dashboard, to look similar to the following:\ngoogle_analytics: id: 'G-XXXXXXXXXX' # Fill with your Google Analytics ID pv: # The Google Analytics pageviews switch. enabled: true # the next options only valid when `google_analytics.pv` is enabled. proxy_url: 'https://PROJECT_ID.REGION_ID.r.appspot.com' proxy_endpoint: 'https://PROJECT_ID.REGION_ID.r.appspot.com/query?id=&lt;ID FROM SUPER PROXY>' cache: false # pv data local cache, good for the users from GFW area.\nNow, you should see the Page View enabled on your blog.\nReference\n[^ga-filters]: Google Analytics Core Reporting API: Filters"

It required custom tools for its team leaders to enable them to administer dispatched staff at off-site testing locations more effectively.\nThey needed a specific and focused view of the data on their subordinates, including timecards, absenteeism, ratings and a way to manipulate these effectively. These data were from a 3rd party system and originally synced Shiftboard via Azure App Logic.\nThe Impact Health Success Story\nMetrics\n\n~2500 monthly events\n\n5K-10K placed staff monthly\n\n~400 active team-leads\n\nScreenshots\n\nMore images...\n\nImage gallery - Application screenshots\n\nInitial problems\nThe initial solution was developed for approx. 4 months was failing, the reasons:\n\nWrong hire (non lead and non mature enough senior developers) resulted in quality issues in the developed product. Missing software related processes made it hard to track progress or to track deployed changes also lead to faulty deployments too (both on .NET and Angular side).\n\nNon-ideal tool selection for synchronization logic - showed as a problem just later on, the functions in Azure Logic App were repetitive, hard to adjust, ignored some architectural characteristics of the platform (rate limiting), and the ineffective (non-batched) coding approach resulted in long synchronization times and sometimes even failing without a trace.\n\nFirst steps we took\n\nStabilized deployment and traceability of work by introducing git-flow, creating CI/CD pipeline in Azure DevOps.\n\nWe fixed architecture, and introduced environment settings in the applications, and defined some routing rules for UI.\n\nStarted to replace the UI screens step-by step. This included changes inside the API (back-end) code.\n\nAt the end of the 2nd month: the entire application was replaced with a new one (redesigned screens, stable functions)\nFrom this moment on we could focus on new enhancements and continuous improvements.\nNew possibilities\nHaving less support tickets (bugs) enabled us to focus on getting the sync process right - we moved from Azure App Logic to a custom but generic .NET function, which we executed periodically via integrating Hangfire.IO to the back-end.\nWe were able to react to new business requirements instantly as time spent on upkeep was reduced considerably. This enabled us new projects and further possibilities.\nFinal state\nThe project is still in use. It requires minimal technical attention and has worked without intervention for over months in a strike."
