    <title>The Seven Stages of Expertise in Software Engineering</title>

    <summary>This article is still **relevant for any startup or company involved in software development**. It contains useful informations - just like &quot;Clean Code&quot; by Robert C Martin - **details within this article are timeless**.

I first came across this article around 2016, when I noticed a large **disparity between the usual junior-mid-senior scaling** of developers. This scaling system, unlike others, is **universal**, easy to understand, and **the bear hunting analogy** used in the original article by Meilir Page-Jones makes it a **humorous and enjoyable read**.

Since then, the original page has been taken down (an archive can be found here). With the permission of the author, I am allowed to distribute the original article.

I made some slight changes by adding additional titles and styling. **Since there is more behind the seven stages, it is likely to be referenced frequently.**

**We hope you enjoy reading this article and that it helps your next projects be successful.**</summary>

    <summary>In the fast-paced world of startups, the journey to success is fraught with uncertainties. Startling statistics reveal that **only a mere 1% of startups manage to reach the coveted IPO stage**, with a significant number meeting their demise within the initial five years[^1].

The idea of working for equity alone is a double-edged sword, raising questions about the feasibility and motivations of those with extensive technical expertise considering this path.</summary>

    <summary>**In a world where exceptional technical leadership can make or break a company, it&#39;s essential to consider the role of a Chief Technology Officer (CTO) with utmost care.**

Selecting the right CTO is a critical decision, one that can significantly impact your business at its current stage and align with the existing roles within your engineering team. The wrong choice can lead to friction, inefficiencies, and unnecessary expenses, while the right one can act as an enabler, streamlining processes, and facilitating seamless future development without additional sacrifices.

**Here&#39;s the good news:** you don&#39;t always need a _full-time_ CTO (and deep pockets) to get the tech expertise you need. Clear up some _common misconceptions_, match your CTO to your business, and watch it thrive.</summary>
